# Fs

Fs is a text file search tool. It searches for regex pattern matches in the directory and subdirectories that it is told to.
By default is will start searching in the directory it is located in.

I wanted to learn a little more about vim/vimscript so I decided to build a (very) simplified version of [the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).
The basic design was inspired by [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)

Both of these tools are way better then Fs.
